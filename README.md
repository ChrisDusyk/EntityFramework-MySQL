# Entity Framework and MySQL-variants
I recently did a project involving ASP.NET 4.6.1, Entity Framework 6.1.3, and Amazon Aurora. Aurora is Amazon's distributed database engine, designed to take advantage of the processing available in a large cloud datacentre. I initially found it very challenging to connect Entity Framework code-first to MySQL, however I've found info in a few places and can put together a better tutorial and sample here.

WIP!
